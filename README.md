# 📖  book world: plain JavaScript with objects <a name="about-project"></a>

**iread** is a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. We achieve that by using JavaScript objects and arrays. We also dynamically modify the DOM and add basic events. we use Github flow and a descriptive and easy-to-understand README file.
.this app will get a complete and working navigation feature at later stages.
